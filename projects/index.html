            <p>Upon completing this week's summer boot camp I hope to walk away being confident in creating/designing future web pages.</p>

            <p>So to kick things into gear I'll introduce some of my favorite tv shows that has a special place in my heart.</p>

            <p>To be clear all images that I am going to present are not my work. And the links that leads to other sites are not my work as well.</p>
